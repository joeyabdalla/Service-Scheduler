## System Overview

The platform employs a mixture of technologies to achieve high efficiency and versatility:

- **Main Backend**: Ruby on Rails (can also be Flask or Spring depending on requirements)
- **AI/ML Microservice**: Flask (serving models trained with scikit-learn and PyTorch)
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Celery for background operations
- **Server**: Gunicorn for Flask. Puma or Unicorn for Ruby on Rails. Tomcat for Spring.
  
### Database Structure

The database setup includes:

- **Businesses Table**: Details of businesses.
- **Services Table**: Services offered by businesses.
- (Expand with more tables as required)

### System Flow

The primary user flow initiates from the frontend, interacts with the Ruby on Rails backend (or Flask or Spring), and communicates with the database. For machine learning predictions or any AI/ML functionalities, the Flask AI microservice is called. (Consider adding a link to a system architecture diagram or flowchart.)

## API Endpoints

The platform exposes several endpoints:

- `GET /api/businesses`: Fetch all businesses.
- `POST /api/business`: Add a new business.
- ... (Expand with more endpoints, their methods, and expected behaviors)

## Deployment Process

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the respective environments for Ruby on Rails/Flask/Spring.
3. Install dependencies.
4. Run database migrations.
5. Start the respective server.
6. Launch Celery workers for asynchronous tasks.
7. (Any additional steps, e.g., setting up a Redis instance for Celery)

## Getting Started for Users
